-- incidents — single table, two access levels enforced by AVP
--
-- Public fields:  id, title, severity, status, created_at
-- Sensitive fields: affected_customers, internal_notes, remediation_details, postmortem_url
--
-- The KB agent is permitted to read public fields only (resource: incidents).
-- The security engineer is permitted to read all fields when elevated (resource: incidents_sensitive).
-- The application applies the column filter based on the AVP decision.
